# Tutorial 3 â€“ The Ripple Adder

**Q1.** What is a ripple adder and how does it work?  
**A1.** A ripple adder is a quantum circuit that is used to perform binary addition operations in such a way that the adding operations and the carry outs ripple or propagate from the LSB to the MSB.

**Q2.** Using two 3-bit binary integers, illustrate how the ripple adder works and how carry outs are handled.  
**A2. (Completed)** Example: A = 101 (5), B = 011 (3).  
- Step 1 (LSB): 1 + 1 = 0 with a carry of 1.  
- Step 2 (middle bit): 0 + 1 + carry(1) = 0 with a carry of 1.  
- Step 3 (MSB): 1 + 0 + carry(1) = 0 with a carry of 1.  
Final result: 1000 (8).  
This shows how the carry ripples from LSB to MSB.

**Q3.** What are the major components of a typical ripple adder?  
**A3. (Completed)** The major components are:  
- Full adder blocks (one per bit)  
- XOR/CNOT gates for sum operations  
- AND/Toffoli gates for carry operations  
- Carry chain logic to pass carry between stages

**Q4.** What quantum gate corresponds to each of the following classical binary logical gates: NOT, XOR, AND?  
**A4.** Not = Pauli X  
XOR = CNOT  
AND = Toffoli

**Q5.** Explain how the above quantum gates (answers of question 4) are used to perform each of the following two operations for each position of the full adder: 1. Sum operation 2. Carry out operation  
**A5.** Each bit in the sum is computed by doing XOR / CNOT operations with the corresponding bit in A then the corresponding bit in B then the carry in bit.  
Carry out relies on applying and gate / Toffoli with the corresponding bits from A and B as the control bits. Then, another Toffoli gate is applied with the sum and carry in as the control qubits.  
S = A XOR B XOR Cin  
Cout = (AB) + (Cin * (A XOR B))

**Q6.** How many qubits are needed to add two 3-bit numbers A and B? For which purpose is each qubit used?  
**A6.** We need three qubits to store the binary bits of A and B each, adding to 6 qubits. Then, we need four more qubits to store the carry in for every step along with the final carry out. Then, we need three qubits to store the sum in every step, adding altogether to 13 qubits.

**Q7.** How many classical registers are needed for the same problem (adding two binary numbers)?  
**A7. (Completed)** 4 classical registers are needed: 3 to store the sum bits and 1 to store the final carry-out.

**Q8.** What are the gates used, and at what positions are they in the circuit?  
**A8.** Already answered in depth in Q3

**Q9.** Draw the full ripple adder circuit including all qubits and gates.  
**A9.** skip

**Q10.** Explain in detail how inputs are passed to the main circuit. For example, if you wanted to add the numbers 7 and 5, how are these two numbers passed as inputs for the main circuit?  
**A10.** The numbers are mapped to their binary form. Then, the number  placements are flipped and they are loaded into an array such that a[0] is the LSB for operational convenience. The correct bits are mapped by applying Pauli X gate to the qubit whenever the current index has a value of 1 to flip from 0 to 1 in the array
