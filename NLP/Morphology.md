## 2. Types of Morphemes

### 2.1 Free Morphemes
- **Definition**: A free morpheme can stand alone as a word.
- **Example**:  
  - *friend* in **friendly**  

Free morphemes can be further divided into:

1. **Lexical (Content) Morphemes**  
   - Carry specific meaning.  
   - Examples: *book*, *run*, *friend*

2. **Functional Morphemes**  
   - Include articles, pronouns, and conjunctions.  
   - Do not carry a specific lexical meaning.  
   - Examples: *and*, *in*, *the*, *that*, *it*, *she*

---

### 2.2 Bound Morphemes
- **Definition**: A bound morpheme cannot stand alone; it must be attached to another form.  

Bound morphemes include:

1. **Bound Stems**  
   - Stems that cannot exist independently.  
   - Example: *re* in **reduce**  

2. **Affixes**  
   - **Prefixes**: Appear at the beginning of a word to change its meaning.  
     - Example: *un* in **unhappy**  
   - **Suffixes**: Appear at the end of a word to modify its grammatical function or meaning.  
     - Example: *-ness* in **happiness**

## 3. Derivational vs. Inflectional Morphemes

### 3.1 Derivational Morphemes
- **Purpose**: Create new words or change the grammatical category of existing words.  
- **Examples**: *un*, *-ness*, *-ly*, *-less*, *co-*  
  - *unhappy* (*un* + *happy*)  
  - *happiness* (*happy* + *-ness*)  

### 3.2 Inflectional Morphemes
- **Purpose**: Modify a word’s grammatical function (e.g., tense, number, possession) without changing its grammatical category.  
- **Examples**: *-ed*, *-s*, *-'s*, *-ing*  
  - *talked* (*talk* + *-ed* for past tense)  
  - *dogs* (*dog* + *-s* for plural)

#### 3.2.1 Special Cases of Inflection
- **Zero Inflectional Morpheme**:  
  - *sheep* → *sheep* (singular and plural forms are identical)  
- **Suppletive Inflectional Morpheme**:  
  - *man* → *men* (the entire root changes)

## 4. Summary
- **Morpheme**: Minimal unit of meaning or function.  
- **Free Morphemes**: Stand alone (e.g., *friend*, *book*).  
- **Bound Morphemes**: Cannot stand alone; include **affixes** (e.g., *un-*), **bound stems** (e.g., *re-*).  
- **Derivational Morphemes**: Change word meaning/category (e.g., *un-*, *-ness*, *-ly*).  
- **Inflectional Morphemes**: Change grammatical function (e.g., *-ed*, *-s*) but not the word’s category.
