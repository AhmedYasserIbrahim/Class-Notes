# Dynamic Semantics of Programming Languages

**Dynamic semantics** refer to the meanings of expressions, statements, and programming units within a programming language. While defining notations for syntax is relatively straightforward, there is no universally accepted notation for defining dynamic semantics, even though such definitions are often needed.

## Methods for Defining Dynamic Semantics

There are three primary methods for defining dynamic semantics:

1. **Operational Semantics**
2. **Axiomatic Semantics**
3. **Denotational Semantics**

## 1. Operational Semantics

**Operational semantics** define the meaning of a program by executing its statements on either a real or simulated computer. The changes in the machine's state during execution provide the meaning of the program.

### Key Concepts:
- **Execution-Based Meaning**: Understanding the program by running its statements and observing the state changes.
- **Abstract Example**: Running code in any programming language and interpreting the output or state to define the program's behavior.

### Usage of Operational Semantics:
- Typically used with **intermediate-level languages** (not machine-level or higher-level languages).
- Real computers are generally avoided due to:
  - **Large memory size**: Real computer memory is too complex to track efficiently.
  - **Frequent state changes**: The number of changes in machine state is too large, making it difficult to track.

### Using Interpreters:
- **Hardware Interpreters**: Not commonly used due to high costs.
- **Software Interpreters**: Although more practical, they have issues:
  - Machine-dependent.
  - The complexity of the machine's architecture makes the meaning hard to understand.

### Approach to Operational Semantics:
- Start by creating an **intermediate programming language** that is optimized for clarity.
- Use a **software interpreter** for this intermediate language instead of an actual computer.
- The language is defined in terms of **statements in a lower-level programming language** rather than using mathematical logic.

### Simulating Operational Semantics:
A better alternative is to:
1. Build a **translator** to convert the program into an intermediate form.
2. Build a **simulator** for an idealized computer.

### Pros and Cons:
- **Advantages**:
  - Often used in **manuals** and **teaching** to help learners understand programming languages.
  - Useful in informal descriptions of programming language behavior.
  
- **Challenges**:
  - **Complexity**: When used formally, operational semantics become extremely complex due to the sheer number of state changes involved.

## 2. Axiomatic Semantics

**Axiomatic semantics** use formal logic (specifically **predicate calculus**) to verify programs. The meaning of a program is determined by **axioms** and **inference rules** assigned to each statement.

### Key Concepts:
- **Assertions**: Logic statements (predicates) that describe relationships between program variables.
  - **Precondition**: An assertion before a statement, defining constraints and relationships that must be true before execution.
  - **Postcondition**: An assertion after a statement, describing what must be true after execution.
  - **Weakest Precondition (WP)**: The least restrictive precondition that guarantees the postcondition is met.

### Correctness of a Program:
- The **postcondition** of the entire program should represent the **desired result**.
- The **precondition** represents the **specification** of the program.
  - If these align, the program is considered **correct**.

### Axioms and Inference Rules:
- **Axiom**: A true logic statement.
- **Inference Rules**: These are used to derive the truth of new statements based on other statements and variables.
  - **Antecedent**: The upper part of an inference rule (the "if" part).
  - **Consequent**: The lower part of an inference rule (the "then" part).

An axiom is an inference rule that is **always true**, so it has no antecedent.

## 3. Denotational Semantics (To Be Added)

---

## Additional Notes

- **Operational Semantics** is useful in teaching and manuals due to its concrete, execution-based approach. However, its formal application is quite complex.
- **Axiomatic Semantics** provides a solid foundation for **program verification**, especially for proving correctness, using logical rules and formal proofs.
