# Programming Languages - Parsing and Lexical Analysis

## Overview of Language Processing Systems

Language processing systems need to process the source code from a particular language independently of its implementation details. This is often done based on the formal description of a language in a concise format known as **BNF (Backus-Naur Form) rules**. Parsers are typically built on these BNF rules, which makes the parser more maintainable.

## Phases of Syntax Analysis

The syntax analysis of the source code is divided into two phases:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Lower level)** 
2. **Syntax Analysis (Higher level)**

Separating these phases provides several benefits:
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies the parser.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes the lexical analyzer.
- **Portability**: The lexical analyzer may have non-portable components, but the parser is always portable.

## Lexical Analysis

### Key Functions of a Lexical Analyzer
The lexical analyzer performs **pattern matching** on the characters in the source code and is considered the front-end of the parser, which it calls to identify the next token.

- **Tokens**: Groups of characters that have collective meaning.
- **Lexemes**: Instances of tokens in a language.
- **Pattern**: Defines how a token in the language can be formed.

### Building Lexical Analyzers
Lexical analyzers can be constructed in two ways:
- Based on a **formal description** of the language.
- Using **state diagrams** (more practical with character and digit classes for optimization).

Identifiers and reserved words are processed similarly using a lookup table to determine if an identifier is reserved.

### Core Functions of the Lexical Analyzer
1. **getChar**: Fetches the next character, stores it in `nextChar`, and determines its class (stored in `charClass`).
2. **addChar**: Adds the `nextChar` to the lexeme being accumulated.
3. **lookup**: Checks the lookup table to determine if the identifier is a reserved word or not.

## Goals of Parsers

The goals of any parser include:
1. **Identifying Syntax Errors**: Helps in detecting and reporting errors.
2. **Building Parse Trees**: Constructs a parse tree (or traces it) from the given source code.

### Parser Runtime Complexity
A general parser for any unambiguous grammar has a time complexity of **O(n³)**. However, compilers use parsers that work on a subset of unambiguous grammars to improve runtime to **O(n)**.

## Types of Parsers

There are two main types of parsers:

1. **Top-Down Parsers**: 
   - Start at the root and use **leftmost derivation**.
   - Common applications: **LL parsers** and **recursive descent**.

2. **Bottom-Up Parsers**: 
   - Start at the leaves and use **rightmost recursion**.
   - Common applications: **LR family of parsers**.

## Top-Down Parsing

In top-down parsing, the parser:
- Compares terminal symbols with the characters in the `nextToken`.
  - If they match, the process continues.
  - If they don’t match, a **syntax error** occurs.
- Calls subprograms for non-terminal characters based on **EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form)** to minimize the number of subprograms.

### Challenges in Top-Down Parsing

1. **Left Recursion**: 
   - Top-down parsers fail with left recursion (A → Aα | β).
   - Solution: Replace recursive calls with a non-terminal (`A'`).

2. **Pairwise Disjoint Problem**: 
   - Occurs when multiple rules for a non-terminal have the same first symbol, making it impossible to decide which rule to apply based on `nextToken`.
   - Example: 
     - A → aB | aC 
     - Both rules start with 'a', so the parser cannot differentiate.

## Bottom-Up Parsing

**Bottom-up parsers** start by looking at the leaves of the parse tree (the lowest level, which are the tokens) and work their way up to the root (the starting symbol). They perform a **rightmost derivation** in reverse.

### Key Concepts

- **Right-Sentential Form**: A string derived from the start symbol using rightmost derivation.
- **Handle**: A substring of the sentential form that can be reduced to a non-terminal symbol using a grammar rule. Identifying the handle is key to working upwards towards the root.

### Process of Bottom-Up Parsing

1. **Shift**: The parser reads tokens from the input and places them onto a stack.
   
2. **Reduce**: When a handle is recognized on top of the stack, it is replaced (or reduced) by the corresponding non-terminal from the grammar rule.

3. **Shift-Reduce Parsing**: This alternates between shifting tokens onto the stack and reducing handles to build the parse tree. The parser continues until it reduces everything into the start symbol.

### LR Parsers (Common Bottom-Up Parsers)

**LR parsers** are the most common type of bottom-up parsers. They are efficient and can handle a wide range of grammars used in programming languages. LR parsers are also **table-driven**, meaning they use a predefined table to determine their actions based on the current state and the next token.

- **Shift**: Move the next input token to the stack and push the associated parser state.
- **Reduce**: Replace a handle with its corresponding non-terminal and update the state on the stack using the **GOTO table**.

### Advantages of LR Parsers
- **Efficiency**: They work for a large class of grammars and are as fast as any other bottom-up parser.
- **Early Error Detection**: LR parsers can detect syntax errors as soon as they become apparent in the input.
- **Broad Grammar Support**: They handle a larger class of grammars compared to top-down parsers like LL parsers.

## Difference Between Recursive-Descent and LL Parsing

Both **recursive-descent** and **LL parsing** are forms of top-down parsing, but they differ in how they handle the grammar:

- **Recursive-Descent Parsing**:
  - It’s a manually coded parser where each non-terminal in the grammar has a corresponding function.
  - Simple to implement but can struggle with left recursion.
  - Works well with **EBNF** to reduce the number of subprograms needed.

- **LL Parsing**:
  - Table-driven approach using a predefined parsing table.
  - Can handle **larger grammars** than recursive-descent but still struggles with left recursion and ambiguities.
  - LL parsers use **lookahead tokens** to decide which production rule to apply.

## Additional Notes (Potential Gaps)

- **Ambiguity Handling**: Ambiguity in grammars and how parsers resolve or avoid them could be useful to explore.
- **Error Recovery**: Understanding different techniques for error recovery in parsing would provide more robustness to parsing techniques.
- **LL and LR Differences**: A brief explanation of the differences between LL parsers (top-down) and LR parsers (bottom-up) might be insightful.
