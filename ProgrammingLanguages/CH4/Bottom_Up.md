Here's a step-by-step explanation of **bottom-up parsers** based on the slides. I'll break it down clearly, with examples to make it easier to follow:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Bottom-Up Parsers

**Bottom-up parsers** start at the **leaves** (or tokens) and work towards the **root** (the start symbol) of the parse tree. Their goal is to identify pieces of the input that match the right-hand side (RHS) of a grammar rule and reduce them to the left-hand side (LHS) symbol. This process continues until the entire input is reduced to the start symbol.

### Step 1: **Understanding Sentential Forms and Handles**
- A **sentential form** is any string derived from the start symbol of the grammar.
- A **handle** is a substring of a sentential form that can be reduced using a grammar rule.

**Example**:  
Consider a simple grammar:
```
E → E + E
E → id
```
For the input string `id + id`, the sentential form `E + E` is derived. Here, `id` is a handle because it can be reduced to `E`.

### Step 2: **Shift Action**
The first action in bottom-up parsing is **shifting**. This means reading the next token from the input and pushing it onto a stack.

**Example**:
Let’s say the input is: `id + id`.
- Start with an empty stack: `[]`.
- **Shift** the first token `id` onto the stack: `[id]`.

### Step 3: **Recognizing a Handle**
After shifting a token, the parser checks the top of the stack to see if it matches the **right-hand side (RHS)** of any grammar rule. If a match is found, the parser recognizes this substring as a handle.

**Example**:
In our grammar, `E → id`, so the parser can reduce `id` to `E` because `id` is a handle.

### Step 4: **Reduce Action**
Once a handle is recognized, the parser performs a **reduce** action. It pops the handle (the RHS) from the stack and replaces it with the corresponding non-terminal (the LHS of the grammar rule).

**Example**:
- Stack before reduction: `[id]`.
- **Reduce** `id` to `E` using the rule `E → id`.
- Stack after reduction: `[E]`.

### Step 5: **Continue Shifting and Reducing**
The parser alternates between **shifting** tokens and **reducing** handles. It continues this process until the entire input has been reduced to the start symbol.

**Example** (continued):
- After reducing `id` to `E`, the parser shifts the next token `+` onto the stack: `[E, +]`.
- Then, it shifts the next `id`: `[E, +, id]`.
- Now, the top of the stack is `id`, which matches the rule `E → id`. So, it reduces `id` to `E`: `[E, +, E]`.

### Step 6: **Final Reduction to Start Symbol**
The parser continues this process until the stack contains only the start symbol (in this case, `E`).

**Example** (final step):
- After reducing `id` to `E`, the stack becomes `[E, +, E]`.
- This matches the rule `E → E + E`. So, the parser performs a final reduction:
  - Stack before reduction: `[E, +, E]`.
  - **Reduce** using `E → E + E`: `[E]`.
- The input is fully parsed, and the stack contains only the start symbol `E`. The parsing is complete.

### Step 7: **Accept or Error**
If the parser successfully reduces the input to the start symbol, it **accepts** the input as valid according to the grammar. If not, it reports a **syntax error**.

### Key Terminology:
1. **Shift**: Move the next token from the input onto the stack.
2. **Reduce**: Replace a handle on the stack with a non-terminal using a grammar rule.
3. **Handle**: A substring that can be reduced using a rule.
4. **Parse Stack**: A stack used to store tokens and non-terminals during parsing.

### Example Walkthrough:
For input `id + id` and the grammar:
```
E → E + E
E → id
```
1. **Shift** `id`: `[id]`
2. **Reduce** `id` to `E`: `[E]`
3. **Shift** `+`: `[E, +]`
4. **Shift** `id`: `[E, +, id]`
5. **Reduce** `id` to `E`: `[E, +, E]`
6. **Reduce** `E + E` to `E`: `[E]`
7. **Accept** (Input is valid).

### Summary of Key Steps:
1. **Shift** tokens onto the stack.
2. **Recognize a handle** (RHS of a grammar rule).
3. **Reduce** the handle to the corresponding non-terminal (LHS).
4. Continue **shifting** and **reducing** until you reach the start symbol.
5. **Accept** or report a syntax error.

This step-by-step breakdown shows how bottom-up parsers work, alternating between **shifting** and **reducing** to build a valid parse tree from the input.
