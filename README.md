## Class Notes Repository
Welcome to my Class Notes repository! Here, I share my notes from courses taken as a junior student in Computer Science (AI and Data Science) at Prince Sultan University. The notes cover topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science Fundamentals, aiming to help fellow students enhance their understanding of these subjects.

Please note that these resources are licensed, and I kindly ask that you do not take them as your own. Feel free to browse the notes and use them for your studies, and consider contributing if you have additional resources to share. Happy studying!
